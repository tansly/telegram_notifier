# telegram_notifier

A Telegram bot that I use to send notifications from my servers to my phone.
Listens TCP port 6666 on the machine for "notifications", which are (hopefully) plain text.
Sends whatever it receives in a Telegram message.

# TODO

* Configuration: Use a config file for port configuration, API key etc.
* What else?
